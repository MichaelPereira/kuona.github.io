Kuona is a DevOps reporting tool. The idea is to collect data from
development, build and operational reporting systems and visualize
that data to provide insight into the overall effectiveness of the
systems.

Feedback loops are an important measurement - how quickly can a
software asset be evaluated Kuona helps by calculating and visualizing
that feedback loop.
