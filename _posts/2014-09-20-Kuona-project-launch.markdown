Kuona is a tool to help organizations manage their build and release
ecosystem by analyzing the data that is already available in build and
release systems and presenting that data in a more consumable
processed form.

Kuona is build system agnostic but the first target is Jenkins which
is one of the more popular CI systems at the moment.

Target for the first MVP release:

* Count based around servers, builds and pass/fail ratios
* Time-series for build jobs completed over the last week and month.
